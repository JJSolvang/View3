                <h3>Our Message</h3>
                <p>Our team set out to create an adorable cat themed game in the popular match-3 made famous by games such as Candy Crush and Bejeweled. Similarly to these famous games, our game rewards players with a rush of dopamine for each match of 3, 4, and 5 cat tiles.</p>

                <h3>About the Game</h3>
                <p>Tile-matching games such as Candy Crush and Bejeweled have been played and loved by millions for decades. A player is shown an 8x8 grid randomly filled with differently colored items, one item in each grid space. The player can swap any one item with another adjacent item. When matching three or more of the same item in one line, the matched items disappear and the player is awarded points. The award is greater the larger the matched group is. There is no win or loss condition; the playerâ€™s goal is simply to maximize the number of points earned in the least amount of turns. Kitty Combos will be a cat-themed tile-matching game with score-tracking and an online leaderboard.</p>

                <h3>Kitty Combos V2</h3>
                <p>We brainstormed several ideas for expanding our game in the future, given we have adequate time and funding.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the future, we'd like to include levels where tiles populate various board shapes and sizes.</li>
                    <li>Implement a timer.</li>
                    <li>Reduce turn count.</li>
                    <li>A "frantic" tile mode using gifs instead of images.</li>
                    <li>Check for potential matches to make sure the board is solvable.</li>
                    <li>Implement responsive board size.</li>
                    <li>Add keyboard/controller support for accessibility and ADA compliance.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 id="solution">Our Path to Finding The Perfect Match</h2>
            <h3 id="tools">Tools</h2>
            <p>Our group had several tools at our disposal to achieve our goals.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Documentation</li>
                <li>Server</li>
                <li>API</li>
                <li>Database</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>Each member of our group had certain dispositions towards these tools.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gabriel Blake: Leaned towards server and database.</li>
                <li>Yacquub Egal: Was drawn towards testing others' work to make sure they line up with the documentation.</li>
                <li>Lori Latchinian: Worked heavily on the documentation, server, and database.</li>
                <li>Edward Matsyshen: Constructed the game bible and other crucial documentation.</li>
                <li>Jacob Solvang: Contributed to documentation, server, and the API.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>It was these inclinations that lead us to develop our project parts.</p>
            <p>Each week, we worked together in audio calls where we planned out our work on Tuesday and merged our work on Saturday.</p>

                <h3>HTML/CSS (Visual)</h3>

                <h3>HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Technical)</h3>
                <p>I spent a large amount of the first week scaffolding the site. Due to being the sole creator of the wireframe diagrams in our documentation - based off of the descriptions provided by our group, I felt a drive to be the one to put them into practice. I spent a majority of my first week developing, building, maintaining, and updating the formatting to accommodate Lori's gameplay and Gabriel's leaderboard.</p>
                <p>To allow for easy access to multiple "pages" without redirecting to different pages, I created 3 toggleable divs called [gameplay], [leaderboard], and [game-over]. These "pages" contain the necessary content elements to support all of our site goals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Gameplay] acts as both a start menu and the page on which the game is played.</li>
                    <li>[Leaderboard] exists to display both the player's score as well as the global top 16 scores.</li>
                    <li>[Game Over] display's the player's score from the completed game and allows them to submit their score to the global leaderboards.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Api</h3>
                <p>Learning to use asynchronous functions took me many hours of work over the first two weeks of the programming process, but ended up massively paying off. I plan to look into asynchronous functions, fetching, awaiting, responses, and promises in the future to expand my knowledge.</p>
                <img src="/images/apisource.PNG">
                <p>I designed the API fetch code above to be easily modified for future use.</p>
